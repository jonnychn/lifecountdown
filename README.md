Life Countdown

This app visually represents your life in weeks, helping you see how much time you have lived and how much is left if you were to live until 80 years old

Life Visualization in Blocks:

The app divides your life into 8 blocks, with each block representing 10 years of your life.
Each block contains small squares (boxes) that represent each week of those 10 years. There are 520 squares in each block (52 weeks per year × 10 years).
Interactive Age Tracking:

When you open the app, it asks you to enter your current age. For example, if you are 37 years old, it will automatically cross out the weeks that have already passed in your life.
You’ll see the past weeks crossed out, showing how much time you’ve lived so far.
Click to Mark Weeks:

Each week that passes, you can click on a box to cross it out. This helps you keep track of time visually and see how much time you’ve used and how much is left.
Stays Updated:

The app saves your progress locally on your device, so even if you close it and open it later, your crossed-out weeks will still be marked.
Two-Column Layout:

The blocks are displayed in two columns: four blocks on the left (representing the first 40 years) and four blocks on the right (representing the next 40 years), making it easy to view without scrolling sideways.
Purpose:
The app serves as a thoughtful, visual reminder of your time on Earth, showing you how much you’ve lived and what remains, helping you reflect on time’s passage and motivating you to make the most of each week.
